                <h2>Feedback from Daphne Heertjes</h2>
                <p>"Hi Netas,
                    Welcome to our program. Apologies for my late response and comment but I finaly came around to great you. A computer network tuner sounds interesting! It seems you allready have a feel and experience in the IT field which will help you greatly in our program. You might find the first quartile very easy, but then we step up the game.  You seem to have an intrinsic motivation. But when you say IT what do you like to do most lnowing what you know now? there are so many different aspects to be considered
                    What do you like about corporate life the most?
                    It very much like an IT person to blame themselves, however you can't learn if you never make a mistake. Keep that in mind! So working on changing your mindset from blame to, what can I do next to make it work helps you get less tired.
                    You might need to get used being back in a full time study after working for two years. Sometimes that takes a bit of getting used to. Looks like you like to be outdoors for hobby? we have some students who are like that too. So you might find like minded people. Ofcourse Zeeland offers good Sailing opportunities as you might discover soon. 
                    Looking forward to meet you!
                    Kind regards,
                    Daphne"

                    <h2>My answer to the feedback</h2>
                    <p>First of all Im very grateful for Daphne for the feedback and the some points about me. About corporate life 
                        the most sensation gives me the ambient in work, you can forget everything and just keep going towards
                        yours and the company you work in goals. I totally agree that there is no learning without mistakes, as 
                        I felt this a lot in this project also, haha. Also I agree that it is a bit difficult to get back to learning
                        after some years of working, but I really enjoy it so I think it wont be a problem. Anyway, everything is going 
                        great and I believe it will stay like this.
