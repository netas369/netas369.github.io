            <h2>My programming experience</h2>
            <h5>18/09/2022</h5>
            <p>Before I attended HZ University, I had little programming experience. I know a bit of c++ from a school experience, but everything else I was learning telecommunication systems,
              in which field no programming is required. But I always wanted to learn and apply my ideas using programming languages.

            <h2>My study choice</h2>
            <h5>From SKC, 13/09/2022</h5>
            <p>I have completed vocational school in IT field and basically the whole my life was around the computers. After I finished school I got a job in very big telecommunication company where I got 4 months training in telecommunications field and I really enjoyed it. I believe we all have our own field where we could be great and I believe that IT field is where I can achieve the most and I think I wouldnt enjoy something else as I enjoy learning IT.</p>
