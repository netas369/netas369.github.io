            <h2>My study choice</h2>
            <h5>From SKC, 13/09/2022</h5>
            <p>I have completed vocational school in IT field and basically the whole my life was around the computers. After I finished school I got a job in very big telecommunication company where I got 3 months training in telecommunications field and I really enjoyed it. I believe we all have our own field where we could be great and I believe that IT field is where I can achieve the most and I think I wouldnt enjoy something else as I enjoy learning IT.</p>
