                <h2>My opinion about company Apple and its own operating system iOS</h2>
               
                <p>Personally I am big fan of the company Apple and its products, but on the other side Im really dissapointed
                    with its IT field. What do I mean by that? I mean that the other companies as Google with the operating system
                    "android" is way ahead of iOs, unfortunately.. Android has much more functions and I believe it is more about the
                    user and to make better experience for user. For this reason and price tag of apple Im really dissapointed about it.
                    I think they should focus more on the experience for user than profit, of course the products quality is great, but 
                    still missing a lot of points. I hope in the future this will change, and I believe if they would go with this 
                    step it would generate even more profit, as it is what they want. 
                    </p>
